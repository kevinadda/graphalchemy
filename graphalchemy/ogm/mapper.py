class Mapper(object):
    """Define the correlation of class attributes to database table
    columns.

    The :class:`.Mapper` object is instantiated using the
    :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.mapper` function.    For information
    about instantiating new :class:`.Mapper` objects, see
    that function's documentation.


    When :func:`.mapper` is used
    explicitly to link a user defined class with table
    metadata, this is referred to as *classical mapping*.
    Modern SQLAlchemy usage tends to favor the
    :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.declarative` extension for class
    configuration, which
    makes usage of :func:`.mapper` behind the scenes.

    Given a particular class known to be mapped by the ORM,
    the :class:`.Mapper` which maintains it can be acquired
    using the :func:`.inspect` function::

        from sqlalchemy import inspect

        mapper = inspect(MyClass)

    A class which was mapped by the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.declarative`
    extension will also have its mapper available via the ``__mapper__``
    attribute.
